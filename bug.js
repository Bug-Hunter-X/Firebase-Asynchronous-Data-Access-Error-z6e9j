The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a field in a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This can happen if you're using asynchronous operations without properly handling promises or callbacks. For example, if you fetch data from Firebase and immediately try to access a field in the snapshot without awaiting or using `.then()` or `.catch()`, you'll likely encounter this issue.
